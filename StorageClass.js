// Declare a class 'Storage' with 2 properties: size and capacity. The 'size' property keeps track of the number of
//current elements in the storage. The 'capacity' property is the maximum number of elements that storage can safely
// store. 'Storage' classes should function similarly to an Array - i.e. they will store values at numbered indexes,
// starting at 0.
// - Task 1: Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes in a single argument for the capacity property
// and initializes the size and the capacity. When a Storage is first created, it should have a size of 0.

// - Task 2: Declare a function 'add', which is accessible to ALL instances of 'Storage'. 'add' should take in a single
// argument, and when invoked on a Storage instance, should add the argument to the first available position of that
//Storage and return the size of the instance. However, if the 'capacity' is exceeded, return "Maximum size exceeded!".

// - Task 3: Declare a function 'remove', which is accessible to ALL instances of 'Storage'. 'remove' should take in
// a single argument which is the value that needs to be removed, and when invoked on a Storage instance, should
//remove all the properties with the corresponding value from the instance and return the size of that instance.
//If the value doesnâ€™t exist, return "No values found!".
